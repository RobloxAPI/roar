<section id="about">

The Roblox API Reference project aims to provide a quick and accessible
reference for the Roblox Lua API.

This site is generated by the [`roar` tool]({{<param "repo">}}). This is a
special purpose program that pulls information from a number of sources, and
processes them into an intermediate format. [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) is then
used to present this information as a human-readable website.

Information presented by this website is derived from the following sources:

- **API dumps**: A machine-generated representation of Roblox's Lua API in the
  JSON format.
- **Reflection metadata**: Supplementary information about the Lua API, in XML
  format.
- [**Creator Docs**](https://github.com/Roblox/creator-docs): The source
  repository for Roblox engine documentation.

This site is hosted statically on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com).

This project is an alternative to the [Roblox Engine API Reference]({{<param
"creatorhub">}}) on the Creator Hub. The Creator Hub provides official,
canonical, up-to-date documentation for the Roblox Lua API.

If you find a bug, have a suggestion, or otherwise wish to contribute, you may
post an issue or make a pull request on the [issues
page]({{<param "issues">}}).
