<section id="about">

The Roblox API Reference project aims to provide a quick and accessible
reference for the Roblox engine API.

This site is generated by the {{%external param=`repo`%}}`roar` tool{{%/external%}}.
This is a special purpose program that pulls information from a number of
sources, and processes them into an intermediate format. {{<external href="https://gohugo.io">}}Hugo{{</external>}}
is then used to present this information as a human-readable website.

Information presented by this website is derived from the following sources:

- **API dumps**: A machine-generated representation of Roblox's engine API in
  the JSON format.
- **Reflection metadata**: Supplementary information about the engine API, in
  XML format.
- {{%external href=`https://github.com/Roblox/creator-docs`%}}**Creator Docs**{{%/external%}}:
  The source repository for Roblox engine documentation.

This site is hosted statically on {{<external href="https://pages.github.com">}}GitHub Pages{{</external>}}.

This project is an alternative to the {{<external param="creatorhub">}}Roblox Engine API Reference{{</external>}}
on the Creator Hub. The Creator Hub provides official, canonical, up-to-date
documentation for the Roblox engine API.

If you find a bug, have a suggestion, or otherwise wish to contribute, you may
post an issue or make a pull request on the {{<external param="issues">}}issues page{{</external>}}.

### Roblox

> {{<external href="https://corp.roblox.com">}}Roblox{{</external>}}
> builds the tools and platform that empower people to create their own
> immersive experiences, so that any world they can imagine can be brought to
> life. Our vision is to reimagine the way people come together to create, play,
> explore, learn, and connect with one another.

### Luau
> {{<external href="https://luau-lang.org">}}Luau{{</external>}}
> (lowercase u, /ˈlu.aʊ/) is a fast, small, safe, gradually typed embeddable
> scripting language derived from {{<external href="https://www.lua.org">}}Lua{{</external>}}.
> It is designed to be backwards compatible with Lua 5.1, as well as
> incorporating some features from future Lua releases, but also expands the
> feature set (most notably with type annotations). Luau is largely implemented
> from scratch, with the language runtime being a very heavily modified version
> of Lua 5.1 runtime, with completely rewritten interpreter and other
> performance innovations.
